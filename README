The purpose of this project is to share some code that I have developed for validating form data using jQuery and a web service.

Components of the Demo:
- A simple ASP.Net Form for for collecting contact data
- A jQuery AJAX call to a C# Web Service
- A C# Class that validates the form data and returns HTML error messages where validation fails
